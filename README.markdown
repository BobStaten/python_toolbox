# What is the Python Toolbox? #

The Python Toolbox is a collection of Python tools for various tasks. It
contains:

 - `python_toolbox.caching`: Tools for caching functions, class instances and
   properties.
 
 - `python_toolbox.cute_iter_tools`: Tools for manipulating iterables. Adds
   useful functions not found in Python's built-in `itertools`.
 
 - `python_toolbox.context_managers`: Pimping up your context managers.
 
 - `python_toolbox.emitters`: A publisher-subscriber framework that doesn't
   abuse strings
   
 - And much, much more! The Python Toolbox contains *hundreds* of useful little
   tools.
