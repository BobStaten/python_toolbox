GarlicSim is a platform for writing, running and analyzing simulations. It can handle any kind of simulation: Physics, game theory, epidemic spread, electronics, etc.

The program is written in Python.


When you're writing a simulation, about 90% of the code you write is boilerplate; Code that isn't directly related to the phenomenon you're simulating, but is necessary for your simulation to work.
The aim of GarlicSim is to write that 90% of the code once and for all, and to do it well, so you could concentrate on the important 10%.

*__Serious Python coders are needed.
