Tutorial part 2: Writing your first simpack
===========================================

In part 1 of the tutorial, we were playing around with someone else's simpack.
In part 2, we are going to make our own.

Motivation for our simpack
==========================

A few years ago, I was talking with a friend of mine about gambling. He said, "I
thought of a really sure-fire way to win money at a coinflip game. (Where it's
50/50 chance between doubling your money and losing it.) You bet $100. If you
win, you won $100 and you're done. If you lose, you bet $200. If you win that,
you've still got a net win of $100, and you're done. If you lose, you bet $400.
If you win *that*, you still have a net win of $100, etc."

"I guess you have a small chance of losing all your money, that's the drawback."

"Yeah, but you're almost sure to win the $100. So let's say you come to the
casino with $5,000, and you want to make $1,000. You use my method 10 times in a
row, and you almost certainly win $1,000!"

"I don't know..."

We're going to make a simpack that will test whether my friend's method for
beating the casino is any good.
